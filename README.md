## Purpose

This project is used to illustrate different Django concepts, libraries, methodologies and patterns used in a Django project.

The foundation of the project is the polls application described at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/.

I also plan to use this project as an example with different blog posts I write around Python and Django.

## Setup

The project uses Python 3.10 and Django 4.0.

Create a virtual environment.

Install the requirements by running the following command

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Setup appropriate environment variables by using .env.dist as reference.

Execute the tests by running the following command

    pytest
